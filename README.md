# SAL_384_Final_Project
 Predicting MLB seasonal WAR for batters and pitchers between 2010 and 2020 using various statistics from Fangraphs.com

# Web Scraping Code

`SAL_384_Final_Project_Code.ipynb` Includes code to scrape data from Fangraphs, produce correlation coefficients between certain statistics and WAR, model WAR using those statistics, and visualize the relationships between each selected variable and WAR.

# Data

The data include batting statistics like HR, SB, BABIP, wOBA and pitching stats like HR/9, BABIP, FIP, and ERA. For both batters and pitchers, these statistics were used to model WAR and their predictive capabilities were explained by Pearson's correlation coefficients.

The data for this project was courtesy of Fangraphs. Link: https://www.fangraphs.com/
